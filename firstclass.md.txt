First step: Is to open the gitcmd.
Second step: Create a directory or folder

"C:\Users\welcome>md gitdemo"

Third step:Change the directory.

"C:\Users\welcome>cd gitdemo".
  
Fourth step:Initialize the directory (Git repo)
"C:\Users\welcome\gitdemo>git init"
Initialized empty git repostiory and the "path" will be displayed.
 
Fifth step: Create a file and save it with .md exetension.

Sixth step: Check the status of the git repo.

Seventh step: Add the git with the valid file name or add by using . by using this method all the files in 
the directory will be included.

"git add."

Eight step: Configure the local repo to online repo
